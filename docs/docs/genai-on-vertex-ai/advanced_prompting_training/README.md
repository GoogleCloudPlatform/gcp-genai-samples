# Advanced Prompt Engineering Training

The [notebook](./cot_react.ipynb) in this folder teaches two powerful prompting techniques: chain of thought and ReAct (Reasoning + Acting).

ReAct (and its variants) are the current state-of-the-art prompting technique to improve LLM reasoning while minimizing hallucinations. And chain of thought is a relatively low-effort technique to improve prompt performance and robustness by adding verbal reasoning.

The notebook also covers LLM tools/actions, self consistency, zero-shot chain of thought, and some basics of how Langchain does ReAct.

## Requirements

To run the walkthrough and demonstration in the notebook you'll need access to a Google Cloud project with the [Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/aiplatform.googleapis.com) enabled.
