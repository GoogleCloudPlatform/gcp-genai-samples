# Research Operationalization

This folder contains code samples and hands-on labs demonstrating the operationalization of latest research models or frameworks from Google DeepMind and Research teams on Google Cloud including Vertex AI.

* **[TimesFM - Time-Series Foundation Model](timesfm/README.md)**: This folders illustrates the operationalization of [TimesFM model](https://research.google/blog/a-decoder-only-foundation-model-for-time-series-forecasting/) in a generative AI application, in the context of a retail merchant analyzing performance of a particular item/product.
