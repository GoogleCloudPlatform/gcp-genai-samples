# TimesFM - Foundation Model for Time-Series Forecasting

- **[Operationalizing TimesFM on Vertex AI](operationalizing_timesfm_on_vertexai.ipynb)**: This notebook shows how to operationalize [TimesFM model](https://research.google/blog/a-decoder-only-foundation-model-for-time-series-forecasting/) on Vertex AI in the context of complementing a Vertex AI Gemini based Generative AI application with predictive open source models such as TimesFM. This notebook was demonstrated as part of [Google IO 2024 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bel4pWqA4PE). We recommend to watch the talk to get familiarized with concepts presented in this notebook.
