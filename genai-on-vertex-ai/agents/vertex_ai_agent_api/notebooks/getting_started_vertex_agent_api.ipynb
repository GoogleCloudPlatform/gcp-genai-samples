        "3. The use of Generative AI capabilities is subject to service quotas. Running the notebook using \"Run All\" may exceed your queries per minute (QPM) limitations. Run the notebook manually and if you get a quota error pause for up to 1 minute before retrying that cell. The Vertex AI Agent API defaults to Gemini on the backend and is subject to the Gemini quotas, <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?pageState=(%22allQuotasTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22base_model_5C_22_22%257D_2C%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22gemini_5C_22_22%257D%255D%22%29%29&e=13802955&mods=logs_tg_staging\">view your Gemini quotas here</a>.\n"
