        "3. The use of Generative AI capabilities is subject to service quotas. Running the notebook using \"Run All\" may exceed your queries per minute (QPM) limitations. Run the notebook manually and if you get a quota error pause for up to 1 minute before retrying that cell.

Many users are seeking recommendations for real estate agents and mortgage brokers, particularly in the East Bay region. There is significant concern about affordability, with some users questioning whether a $1.8 million budget is sufficient for a single-family home in a good school district with a reasonable commute to San Francisco. Others are debating the pros and cons of different neighborhoods, such as Danville versus San Ramon, or the Peninsula versus the East Bay, weighing factors like school districts, commute times, and overall community vibe. Some users are requesting advice on specific property listings, curious about potential red flags or reasons for a property remaining on the market for an extended period.  Discussions also revolve around market trends, with users pondering whether the Bay Area market is cooling down or heading for a crash, and how factors like interest rates and inflation might impact future prices. There\\'s also debate on the reliability of Redfin Estimates and the prevalence of predatory listing practices. Overall, the discussions reflect the competitive and expensive nature of the Bay Area real estate market, with users seeking information, advice, and shared experiences to navigate the complexities of buying or selling in the region.\\n\"\n",

              "  text: \"While the Reddit discussion you linked doesn\\'t contain specific predictions of a market crash, many posts allude to concerns about the Bay Area market cooling down or potentially heading towards a correction.  A user asking about a property priced under $6 million sitting on the market for 40 days in Los Altos reflects a sentiment that homes, even in desirable and expensive areas, aren\\'t moving as quickly as they might have in a hotter market. Additionally, questions about Redfin Estimates and concerns about predatory listing practices, such as listing a property far below its intended selling price, indicate a level of wariness about market manipulations and potentially inflated prices. \\n\\nUltimately, while no definitive pronouncements on a crash are present, the discussions around affordability challenges, properties remaining on the market longer, and skepticism towards pricing strategies suggest a degree of uncertainty and a potential shift in the Bay Area\\'s real estate landscape.  \\n\"\n",
